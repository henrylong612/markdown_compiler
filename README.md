# Markdown Compiler

This repository contains my submission for [project_01](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_01).

Included is a python script that converts mardown syntax into an HTML file. For example, the `mardown_compiler.py` file converted the `README2.md` file into the `README2.html` file. Adding the `--add_css` flag to the command line adds a preset CSS code to the webpage that modifies how the page gets rendered. This script is compatible with escape characters and lists.
